Description
------------
This module adds a chart of an individualâ€™s ancestors and descendants, as a family book (enhanced with marriages, images, and more).

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
Unpack the zip file and place the mitalteli-chart-family-book folder in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default and will work immediately. No additional configuration is required. *NOTE: The directory name must have a maximum length of 30 characters.*

Bugs & feature requests
-------------------------
This is a simple module and provided as is. However, if you experience any bugs you can [create a new issue on GitHub][3]. Since this is a simple module, I will be reluctant to accept feature requests.
