Description
------------
This module adds a chart of an individualâ€™s ancestors and descendants, as a family book (enhanced with marriages, images, and more).

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
Unpack the zip file and place the mitalteli-chart-family-book folder in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default and will work immediately. No additional configuration is required.

*NOTE 1: To generate a pdf you can use print function and select "Save as PDF", then specify a scale percentage in "more options". With Chrome and Edge browsers on Windows OS, 47% has worked fine for me when showing 5 generations horizontaly and setting landscape US Letter page.*

*NOTE 2: The directory name must have a maximum length of 30 characters.*

Translation
-----------
This module contains a few translatable textstrings. Copy the file es.php in the resources/lang folder and replace the Spanish text with the translation into your own language. Use the official two-letter language code as file name. Look in the webtrees folder resources/lang to find the correct code.

It would be great if you could share to the community the translated file by [creating a new issue on GitHub][3].

Bugs & feature requests
-------------------------
This is a simple module and provided as is. However, if you experience any bugs you can [create a new issue on GitHub][3].
